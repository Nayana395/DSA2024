### Visualization
```
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an 
accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data
	- Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
