## Datatypes
```
i. Continuous Variable
			 A continuous variable can take any value within a range. For example, the height of a person can be 170 cm, 170.1 cm, or 170.12345 cm.
		        Measured, Not Counted: Continuous variables are typically measured using tools like rulers, scales, or thermometers.
		        Includes Decimal Values: These variables allow for fractional or decimal values.
                        Eg: Height, Weight, Temperature, Time etc.,
ii. Discrete
			Distinct Values: Discrete variables take on specific, separate values (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
		        Countable: The values can be counted, and there is no intermediate value between two discrete values.
		        No Fractions or Decimals: Discrete variables usually do not take fractional or decimal values. (E.g., you can't have 2.5 cars or 1.75 students.)
		        Eg: Number of cars, Number of heads when flipping two coins
			
iii. Classification and Regression
```
### Visualization
```
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an 
accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data
	- Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 
		       Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible.
		- Figures :  The figure is the blue region and add_subplot has added an Axes artist to the Figure (see Parts of a Figure).
		- Axis labels
		- Sub-figures
		- Ticks

	Type of Plots
		i. Line plot
		ii. Bar Charts
		iii. Pie Charts
		iv. Histogram
		v. CDF plot
		vi. KDE plot
		vii. Scatter plot 
			- with color
		viii. Heatmaps
		ix. Box plots
	- Seaborn

Feature Extraction and Transformation

Features and Labels
Features: Features are the input variables or attributes used by the model to make predictions.
	  They represent the independent variables in the dataset.
	  A feature can be numeric (e.g., age, height) or categorical (e.g., gender, city).
	  Examples:
 		For classification tasks:
		Email Spam Detection: Features could be the email text length, number of links, presence of specific words, etc.
 		Image Recognition: Features are pixel values or extracted patterns from the image.
	  	For regression tasks:
 		Predicting House Prices: Features could include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
 		Predicting Temperature: Features could include time of year, humidity, and altitude.

### Featurization
```
Converting non-numeric data into numerical vector
*   Featurization is often done by domain experts/researchers in that specific field.
*   This is often resulted from many decades of research findings.
*   When you are working on any specific domain, you will have to discuss with domain experts.
*  Read Scientific Literature
*  Deep learning: Automaticall learn correct featurization with lots of data
	- Text data
		- BoW
		- TFIDF

Feature Engineering
	- Feature Orthogonality
		- Cosine Similarity
	- Feature Colinearity
	- Feature Slicing
		Feature slicing: Breaking down a product's features into separate components, or "slices," for independent development.
	- Indicator Variable
	- Feature Binning
		Feature binning: A feature engineering technique that groups different numerical subranges into bins or buckets.
	- Mathematical Transforms
		- Logarithms
		- FFT & STFT
