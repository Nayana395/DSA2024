### Enigma Machine
```
The Enigma Machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early-to-mid  20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.
During World War II German military used it because it was considered so secure that it was used to enipher the most top-secret messages.
For this rotor mechanism was used.
```
### Neuroplasticity
```
The ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganising its structure, functions or connections after injuries susch as stroke or traumatic brain injury.
A period of reduced interest and funding for artificial intelligence (AI) research and development between 1950-2005 called AI winter.

### The Nobel Price in Physics 2024 was awarded to JOHN.J.JOPFIELD and gEOFFREY E hINTON for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with Artificial Neural Network.
### DRPA Grand Challenge
```
DRPA Grand Challenge was a price based competition to attract performers and ideas and encourage collaboration across diverse fields.
```
### Turing Test
```
Turing Test is a widely recognized for evaluating a machines ability to demonstrate human like intelligence.
```
### Artificial General Intelligence
```
Artificial General Intelligence is a type of Artificial Intelligence that matches human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks.
```
### Deep Learning
```
Deep learning in a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, known as deep neural networks to stimulate the complex decision making power of the human brain.
Deep learing models use three or more layers often hundred or thousands to train the models. This allows deep learning models to handle vast amounts of unstructured data and extract features and relationships needed to make accurate outputs.
```
### Data Science
```
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, visualization, etc.
