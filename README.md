First Day in ICT Academy Kerala

It was my first day in ICT Academy Kerala. I am from a different background, that is I qualified Masters in Commerce and experience
in related fields. During the time I was working in the Accounting section I dealt with different types of data regarding accounts.
I liked to sort different data, categorize it and make a summary from it. From the insight of my research mind I searched for a
different platform that I have never experienced earlier. When I paid my first installment and joined the course I was curious
whether it would fit for my career pathway.
