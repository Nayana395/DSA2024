## Measure of Central Tendency
```
Measure of Central Tendency
Measure of Central Tendency is the representation of various values of the given data sest.
i. Mean
ii. Median
iii. Mode
```
### Mean/ Arithmetic Average
```
Mean is commonly used when the data is symmetrically distributed.
Mean = Sum of all the values / Total no. of values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
```
Median
Median is used when the data is skewed. The median is the middle value when the dataset is arranged in ascending or descending order.
Median =  n = 1 / 2
```
### Mode
```
The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. The mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data. It's useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset.
```
### Range
```
The Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.
```
###
Quartiles
```
Quartiles are three values that split sorted data into four parts, each with an equal number of observations.
i. First Quartile
Also known as Q1 or the lower quartile. This is the number halfway between the lower number and the middle number.
ii. Second Quartile
It is also known asd Q2 or the median. This is the middle number halfway between the lowest number anf the highest number,
Third Quartile
It is alson known as Q3 or the upper quartile. This is the nmber halfway between the middle number and the highest number.
```
### Interquartile Range.
