## Measure of Central Tendency
```
Measure of Central Tendency
Measure of Central Tendency is the representation of various values of the given data sest.
i. Mean
ii. Median
iii. Mode
```
### Mean/ Arithmetic Average
```
Mean is commonly used when the data is symmetrically distributed.
Mean = Sum of all the values / Total no. of values                                                                                           
```
### Median
```
Median is used when the data is skewed. The median is the middle value when the dataset is arranged in ascending or descending order.
Median =  n = 1 / 2
```
### Mode
```
The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. The mode can be applied to both numerical and categorical data. It's useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset.
```
### Range
```
The Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset.
```
### Quartiles
```
Quartiles are three values that split sorted data into four parts, each with an equal number of observations.
i. First Quartile (25th percentile)
Also known as Q1 or the lower quartile. This is the number halfway between the lower number and the middle number.
ii. Second Quartile (50th Percentile)
It is also known asd Q2 or the median. This is the middle number halfway between the lowest number anf the highest number,
Third Quartile (75th percentile)
It is alson known as Q3 or the upper quartile. This is the nmber halfway between the middle number and the highest number.
```
### Interquartile Range.                                                                                                            
```
The distance between the first and third quartiles- the interquartile range is a measure of variability. It indicates the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
IQR = Q3- Q1
The IQR is an especiallyt good measure of variability for skewed distributions or distributions with outliers. IQR only includes the middle 50% of the data.

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. A distribution is asymmetrical when its left and right side are not mirror images.
Outlier is a value or point that differs substantially from the rest of the data.
```
### Standard Deviation
```
Standard deciation is ameasure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.
* It is an important method of measuring statistical deviation.
* It is the measure of the extent to which the numbers in a statistical series are spread from their arithmetic mean.
```
### Variance
```
Variance is the squared deviation of values in a statistical series from its arithmetic mean.
```
### Measure of Dispersion
```
Measure of dispersion are used to represent the scattering of data. These are the numbers that show the various aspects of the data spread across various parameters.
