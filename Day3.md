```
On the third day our mentor explained the history of AI Some terms, events and works that leads into Artificial intelligance. Next step hi explained Data Science & Machine Learning  and Python programme & libraries used.
```
### Enigma Machine
```
The Enigma Machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early-to-mid  20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.
During World War II German military used it because it was considered so secure that it was used to enipher the most top-secret messages.
For this rotor mechanism was used.
```
### Neuroplasticity
```
The ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganising its structure, functions or connections after injuries susch as stroke or traumatic brain injury.
A period of reduced interest and funding for artificial intelligence (AI) research and development between 1950-2005 called AI winter.
```
### The Nobel Price in Physics 2024 was awarded to JOHN.J.JOPFIELD and GEOFFREY E HINTON for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with Artificial Neural Network.
### DRPA Grand Challenge
```
DRPA Grand Challenge was a price based competition to attract performers and ideas and encourage collaboration across diverse fields.
```
### Turing Test
```
Turing Test is a widely recognized for evaluating a machines ability to demonstrate human like intelligence.
```
### Artificial General Intelligence
```
Artificial General Intelligence is a type of Artificial Intelligence that matches human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks.
```
### Deep Learning
```
Deep learning in a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, known as deep neural networks to stimulate the complex decision making power of the human brain.
Deep learing models use three or more layers often hundred or thousands to train the models. This allows deep learning models to handle vast amounts of unstructured data and extract features and relationships needed to make accurate outputs.
```
### Data Science
```
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, visualization, etc.
```
### Machine Learning
```
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
It can be divided into two: Supervised Language and Unsupervised Language.
1. Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled data. Labeled data is data that has be tagged with a correct answer or classification.
Types of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 
i. Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
ii. Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” , “disease” or “no disease”.
2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is classified into twomcategories of algorithms:
i. Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent grouping in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour.
ii. Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of yout data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.
```
### PYTHON
```
Python is a versatile and widely used programming language with many applications. Its known for its easy-to-read syntax and broad range of libraries and frameworks.
```
### NumPy
```
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multidimentional arrays and matrics along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
```
### Pandas
```
Pandas is a Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It is fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use and has a large community and ecosystem of support.
```
### Scikit Learn
```
Scikit Learn is a Python module for machine learning. It is an open-source python library that implements a range of machine learning, pre-processing cross-validation and visualization algorithms using a unified interface.
